## Description

This is a command-line application that accepts input from the user and then generates a professional looking README from that input. The README that is generated includes title, table of contents, description, installation, usage, license, contribution, testing, screenshot, links, and questions sections. As the user gives inputs, these sections are filled out with the inputs given. When a license is chosen, a badge representing that license is added next to the title, the license seciton is added to the table of contents, and a license section is added to the markdown giving some information about the license chosen. The listings in the table of contents are links that will jump a viewer to the relevant section.

## Installation
